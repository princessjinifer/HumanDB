A simple database program that keeps records of people

You create each person, and store information within their file, I will be adding profile fields when I figure that out.

To download and install
-----------------------

Download the file files.cpp
Compile it with your compiler.
Make a folder and name it what you want, maybe something like HumanDB
Put the executable in that folder, then create a folder in that folder and name it "profiles", that is where each profile will be kept :)

Hope you enjoy!
